# About HOMEdash:

Information in the form of charts, 2D tables and statistics that fall under the umbrella of the United Nations 2030 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is not readily available in a user-friendly and significantly user-friendly format. Maps are a means of interactive storytelling that can help display data of the UN SDGs as geographic information system (GIS) layers. As such, HOMEdash (which stands for Heartbeat Of Mother Earth dashboard) is a cross-platform application that displays real-time data streams about sustainable development on a 3D globe which users can interact with. Interactions like turning layers on and off, enabling time to see changes, and perform simple analyses to identify patterns will create a more powerful experience. The application should highlight the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and provide access to widgets which display humanityâ€™s progress toward the goals. The user interface is made through Javascript API, with a back-end component using ArcPy and Python3 API, as well as sustainability prediction features using machine learning frameworks with Kaggle and PyTorch accordingly, and a user-end database with AWS services.
